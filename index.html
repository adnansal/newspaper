                          <p>CLEVELAND — At one point in the eighth inning of the epic Game 2 of the wild-card series between the Yankees and the Indians, Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela looked back at the clock on the giant scoreboard at Progressive Field and saw that it was approaching 1 a.m. Thursday.“Oh, this is a long game,” Urshela said to himself in surprise.
                           If not for that glimpse, Urshela would not have known that a game that was supposed to have begun on Wednesday at 7 p.m. had bled into the wee hours of the next day. The game’s many twists and turns — and there were more to come after Urshela checked the time — had captured his attention and captivated those watching at home, presumably with white knuckles. </p>

                         Here we are modeling a single output, so Yˆ is a scalar; in general Yˆ can be
                         a K–vector, in which case β would be a p× K matrix of coefficients. In the
                         (p + 1)-dimensional input–output space, (X, Yˆ ) represents a hyperplane.
                         If the constant is included in X, then the hyperplane includes the origin
                         and is a subspace; if not, it is an affine set cutting the Y -axis at the point
                         (0, βˆ
                         0). From now on we assume that the intercept is included in βˆ.
